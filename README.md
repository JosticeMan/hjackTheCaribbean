# OCEAN COMMANDOS

Concept:  The player will be a ship that navigates through the "ocean" which will be represented by a grid. There are multiple territories, some of which are not owned and some of which are controlled by certain Commanders. To take over the territory controlled by a certain commando, the user must defeat the commando in a game of BattleShip. There will be 3 ships and a 5x5 board given for both users. If the user loses a game and has no territory, they lose the game and are sent back to the start of the game again. There will be certain riptides that disables the player's boat from going a certain direction

Perhaps the grid of territorys will look like this: (S represents a random commander's territory) (-> represents the player's location)
{-----}{-----}{-----}{-----}{-----}
{  -> }{     }{  S  }{     }{     } 
{-----}{-----}{-----}{-----}{-----}
{     }{  T  }{     }{     }{     } 
{-----}{-----}{-----}{-----}{-----}
