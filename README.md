# HJACK THE CARIBBEAN

Concept:  The player, as a pirate, will be a ship that navigates through the "ocean" which will be represented by a grid. There are multiple territories, some of which are not owned and some of which are controlled by certain Commanders and mobs. To take over the territory controlled by a certain commando, the user must defeat the commando in a game of BattleShip/A different game. For mob battles, the player will have to participate in an fire emblem themed fight. For the Commander Battles, there will be 3 ships and a 5x5 board given for both users. If the user loses a game and has no territory, they lose the game. There will be certain riptides that disables the player's boat from going a certain direction. There will also be a chance that the player discovers valuable powerups in unowned territories to help them in future games. There will also be a chance that the player gets items that will make battles against mobs easier. 

Possible Powerups: <br />
BoinkRader - Gives the player a general idea of where one of the opponent's ship is. <br />
CriticalMissile - Sets a missile off that will guarantee a hit on a boat in a turn but the user cannot do anything in that time.  <br />
Stormcaller - The opponent's battleships are surrounded by bad weather and unable to make a player for one turn. <br />

Perhaps the grid of territorys will look like this:
<br />
 |________________| <br />
 |P          ==   | <br />
 |=====     M     | <br />
 |              =B| <br />
 | ===            | <br />
 | T        M ==  | <br />
